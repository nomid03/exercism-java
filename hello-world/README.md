# Hello World

Welcome to Hello World on Exercism's Java Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

Since this is your first Java exercise, we've included a detailed [Tutorial](#tutorial)
that guides you through your solution. Check it out for tips and
assistance!

Welcome to the first exercise on the Java track!

This document is a step-by-step guide to solving this exercise. The
instructions should work equally well on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Even if you are already familiar with Java basics, stepping through this guide
may be helpful as it will help you understand the output from the tool, Gradle,
that we use to compile and test our code, as well as introduce some of the
patterns common to all exercises in this track.

When you fetch a new Java exercise, you will receive:

* __one or more test files__ (always). These live in the `src/test/java`
directory and define a set of tests that our solution must satisfy before we
can safely declare that it is working.
* __one or more starter files__ (initially). If provided, these live in the
`src/main/java` directory and define shells of the classes you will need
in order to solve the current problem.
